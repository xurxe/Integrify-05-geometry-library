# JavaScript Geometry Library

I am making a library of functions to calculate common geometry values:

- Circles and so on:
    - Area and circumference of a circle (given the radius)
    - Area of an annulus (given the inner and outer radius)
    - Volume and surface area of a sphere (given the radius)

- Triangles:
    - Area and perimeter of a right triangle (given the length of both catheti)
    - Area and perimeter of an equilateral triangle (given the length of the sides)
    - Area and perimeter of an isosceles triangle (given the length of the equal sides and the different side)
    - Area and perimeter of any triangle (given the length of the sides)

- Quadrilaterals:
    - Area and perimeter of a square (given the length of the side)
    - Area and perimeter of a rectangle (given the length of the sides)
    - Area and perimeter of a rhombus (given the length of the side OR diagonals)
    - Area and perimeter of a rhomboid (given the length of the sides)
    - Area and perimeter of a rectangle (given the length of the sides)

- Regular polygons:
    - Area and perimeter of any regular polygon (given the length and number of sides)

- Right cylinders and prisms
    - Volume and surface area of any right solid (given the base area and the height)
    - Volume and surface area of a right circular cylinder (given the base radius and the height)
    - Volume and surface area of a uniform prism (given the side length and number)
    - Volume and surface area of a right prism with a regular polygonal base (given the side length, side number, and height)
